### Batch yield and purity
**Description:**	The two columns in the data set are:
- the percentage yield from a batch reactor, and
- the purity of the feedstock.
The feedstock is what we add to the reactor, and the yield is measured after the reaction is completed.

The cause-and-effect direction is that the purity of the feedstock has (potential) impact on the yield.
